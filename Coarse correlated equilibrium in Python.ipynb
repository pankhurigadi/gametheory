    "Coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) is a concept in game theory, specifically in the field of repeated games with incomplete information. It extends the idea of correlated equilibrium to repeated games.\n",
    "\n",
    "In game theory, an equilibrium is a state where no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy given the strategies of the other players. In a correlated equilibrium, a third party (a mediator) suggests a probability distribution over the joint strategies of the players. Each player then independently chooses their strategy based on the advice received from the mediator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A coarse correlated equilibrium relaxes the requirement of a precise correlation device. In a CCE, players' strategies are to commit to the correlation device or to deviate and play a different strategy. A coarse correlated equilibrium exists when accepting the device is the best response for each player when all others are also accepting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is particularly relevant in settings where players may not have access to a centralized mediator or communication channel but can use imprecise signals or randomization to achieve coordination."
